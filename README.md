# Neural Signal Analysis
This repository gathers my class notes and the class scripts of two courses offered by the [Brain Institute at UFRN. Natal, Brazil.](https://www.neuro.ufrn.br/) and taught by professor [Adriano Tort](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=en&user=Z7lq_2gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
They provided the background knowledge in neurocomputational for my [undergraduate research work](https://github.com/victorfmartins/Scientific-Research) at the [Computational Neurophysiology Laboratory](https://tortlab.github.io/).
